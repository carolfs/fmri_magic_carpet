Remember that during the game:

• Your carpets are self-driving.
• You will sleep through the flights and just wake up on a mountain.
• You will have to figure out the meaning of the symbols written on the carpets: which one means “[color_common1] Mountain” and which one means “[color_common2] Mountain.”
• Your eyes will be tracked. Please keep them open.
• In between flights, look at the cross.
• Whenever you are deciding between carpets or lamps, blink as little as possible.
