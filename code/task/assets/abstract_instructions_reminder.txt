Remember that during the game:

• One box will mostly give you the [color_common1] lamps, and the other mostly the [color_common2] lamps.
• Your eyes will be tracked. Please keep them open.
• In between trials, look at the cross.
• Whenever you are deciding between boxes or lamps, blink as little as possible.

Please press the left or right button to continue.
