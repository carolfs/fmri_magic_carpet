"The game will take place inside the fMRI scanner. You will make [num_trials] flights to the mountains and get paid for every gold coin the genies give you."
flight_[color_common1]-[color1]_[color2]

"You will explore other mountains now: [color_common1] Mountain and [color_common2] Mountain. You have bought a new pair of magic carpets to take you there."
flight_[color_common1]-[color1]_[color2]-wind

"Your new carpets are shown below. One has been enchanted by a magician to fly to [color1] Mountain and the other to [color2] Mountain. The symbols written on the carpets mean “[color_common1] Mountain” and “[color_common2] Mountain.”"

"Sometimes your carpets will be on different sides of the room, because each time you want to use them, you take them out of a cupboard and might put them down in different positions."

"The carpets have also been upgraded to be completely self-driving. They will automatically try to fly to the mountain whose name is written on them, but if the wind is too dangerous, a safety procedure will be activated and the carpets will land on the other mountain."

"You have already tested your new self-driving carpets and they work perfectly. Because these flights are long and boring, you will now sleep through them and just wake up at your destination."
nap

"The carpets’ borders will immediately start to glow, and you have 2 seconds to select a carpet before they fly away without you."

tibetan.[isymbol1][isymbol2]

"After you select a carpet, the screen will briefly turn black, because you’ll be taking a nap and only wake up when you are already on one of the mountains."

"During the game, you’ll have to figure out by yourself which symbol means “[color1] Mountain” and which means “[color2] Mountain.” This should be easy, because each carpet will land more often on the mountain whose name is written on it."
carpets
tibetan.[isymbol2][isymbol1]

"For example, the carpet with the symbol that means “[color_common2] Mountain” will always try to land on [color_common2] Mountain, unless the wind forces it to land on [color_common1] Mountain, which happens more rarely."
flight_[color_common2]-[color1]_[color2]

"The wind blows unpredictably and is equally likely to blow near both mountains. You can never predict when it will start or stop."
flight_[color_common1]-[color1]_[color2]-wind

"During a flight, you won’t see the wind blowing because you’ll be sleeping comfortably on your self-driving carpet."

"On a mountain, the lamps will immediately start to glow, and you should press the left or right arrow key to choose a lamp."
lamps_[color_common1]_glow

"Each lamp has the name of the genie that lives inside it written on it."

"The same lamp will be sometimes on the left and sometimes on the right, because each time you pick up a lamp to rub it you might put it down later in a different place."
lamps_[color_common1]
tibetan.[fsymbol12][fsymbol11]

"You must decide quickly which lamp you’re going to rub. If you take more than 2 seconds to make your choice, the genies will assume there won’t be any music and go to sleep."

"Remember that when a genie is currently interested in music, he’ll probably come out of his lamp and give you a coin."

"But when a genie isn’t very interested in music, he’ll tend to stay inside his lamp."

"It is hard to tell how interested in music each genie currently is, but if a genie will often come out of his lamp to listen to your songs, he is probably interested."

"If the word BREAK appears on the screen, you can take a short break before continuing the game."

"As you play the game, your eyes will be tracked. It is very important to keep them open."
