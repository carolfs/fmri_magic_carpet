About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
At the beginning I tried to stick with the same choice for the carpet, in order to know if it was the pink or blue one. Then once I was pretty sure of this, I tried to look for a lamp giving coins. Once I found one, I tried to go for this lamp several times in a row, as long as it was giving coins. When it started to give nothing, I went to look for another lamp or I also went for lamps that were previously known to give coins often.

About the whole experiment

Do you have any other feedback/issue/concern you would like to tell us about?
-------
Only one thing: I wasn't sure for the game with carpets and lamps if after a break the game was reset or not (maybe I didn't see it in the guidelines). But I assume it wasn't reset.
