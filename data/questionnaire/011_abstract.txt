About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I tried to go back to the same lamps as before if they gave me a coin, but at some point I was not lucky enough and I started thinking the probability had changed for the lamps I was trying because it was said that this could happen after some point. So I tried again to find which one was the one with the highest probability but I definately got lost a few times and I was never really sure if my plan was right or not because even the highest chance lamp was not 100% so when it had not a coin I changed and could not test precisely at which time which one was the one with the highest probability.
