About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I would start with a random carpet and then a random bottle in that mountain. If I got a 0, I would pick the other bottle next time round. If I got paid, I would pick this bottle next time round also. I would pick this bottle as long as it paid me, if it didn+t pay me I would pick it at least twice more, meaning I would have to get at least 2 consecutive 0s before I moved on to another one. If I decided to move to another bottle, I would pick one at random OR I would pick one I had already had some success with.
