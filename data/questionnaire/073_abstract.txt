About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
When I found the lamp, where the djinni was hidden, I tried to refind it in the next round and so on until the djinni was not there anymore. So for example, when the djinni was in a blue lamp, I mostly tried to open the box where the blue lamps were to reopen the same lamp. Once the djinni was gone, I tried to switch to the other colour and find the djinni there. Then, if the djinni was in one of the two lamps for several times, as soon as it was not there anymore, I tried to open the other lamp of this colour because I thought that it might have changed. Sometimes, it was also just simple intuition.
