About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
Usually if a genie from one lamp gave a coin I would try to rub that lamp again until he decided not to do it anymore, then I would randomly try another lamp. Over time I noticed some lamps seemed to give out coins more often so when one genie stopped giving coins I would try to select a lamp that liked to give out coins in previous rounds.
