About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
In the beginning I chosed for maybe 6 rounds always the same carpet symbol to find out what colour the symbol has. Then I chosed the can symbol which gave me credits. When I found out which symbols give credits, I switched between these two. If I didn´t get credits, I tried a new can symbol.
