About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
first I just speculated which one is the one to choose then I did the same move several times(about 4) to see how often this decision brings the coin and how often it brings the same color. If it didnt work or better said the chance to earn the coin was very low I changed to another symbol and made the trial again. Then I just tried to stay with on color and symbol.
