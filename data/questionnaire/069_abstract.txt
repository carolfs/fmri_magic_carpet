About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
First 10-20 rounds were to test of each color one lamp for about 5 times (so e.g. always the blue lamp with sign "A" etc.). After having tested a lamp about 5 times, I switched to take always the other sign-lamp of the same color. I counted, how often I recieved something for every lamp and then sticked to the one which gave me most and I choose the box, which had a higher chance of giving me the correct color.
In the first 50 rounds, I was a bit more random, in the second part I tried to stick more to the method I explained. In the last round I still sticked to what I found out in the second part, but after some time I tried out the other lamps as well for about 3 times per lamp.
