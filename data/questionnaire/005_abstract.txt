-------
I tried to find ou which lamp had the highest possibility to get a coin. when a lamp got me a lot of coins I tried to get this lamp over and over again by choosing the box which got me the corresponding colour. Sometimes I noticed that my favorite lamp started to get me less points so I switched to another lamp.
