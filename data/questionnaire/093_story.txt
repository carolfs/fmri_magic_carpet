About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
Once I worked out which genie or lamp was likely to give me a coin, I tried to keep choosing that one or alternate between which genies gave me coins. Once a genie stopped giving me coin, I went back and tested all the lamps again. 
When the wind blew me to a mountain I knew would likely not get me any coins, I just alternated between the available options.
