About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
First of all, to remember exactly the symbols I tried to figure them out as animals or body parts. This helped me to link symbols to color lamps or to winning probability.

At the beginning of the game, I started choosing randomly between on of the two boxes and then between one of the lamps. If win, then I continued to test the same combination, until when I obtained two consecutive losses. If the first choice was a loss, then I immediately changed combination at the following step. I iterated this decisional process throughout all the game. When two consecutive losses occured after a positive strike, I tried to change combination. If any of the other 3 lamps gave a good result, I came back to test the one which was previously giving me a positive strike. If the result was still a loss, I definitely abandoned that lamp with that symbol for some time.
