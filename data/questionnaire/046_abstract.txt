About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I found the most stable one, which under most of the cases will give the coin. Then in case i am not able to navigate to that pot, i will go with the second most stable pot. Also, in most cases the pot will tend to perform the what they did in the last iteration (becasue they are slow changing). So if i get zero in this iteration, then i will not select it in the next trial.
