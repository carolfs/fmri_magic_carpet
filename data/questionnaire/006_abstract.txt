About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
First I randomly tried out a box and a symbol. If I received money with the symbol, I continued the same way to see if the symbol has an overall high percentage of giving me coins (I repeated the same thing for about 3 times). If I did not receive coins three times in a row, I tried the other symbol. Concerning the boxes I soon found out that the pink lamps give me more coins, so I stuck to the same symbol, because I knew the pink lamps would occur more often in the box with said symbol.
