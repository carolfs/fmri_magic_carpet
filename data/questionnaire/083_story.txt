About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
First I tried to figure out which symbol corresponds to which mountain and how likely I get corresponding to the mountain lamps. 
Then I tried one of the lamps and remembered if the cohice was successful. My first strategy was to switch between the mountains to get the most likely genie come out. I followed the described rules that the wind does not change the genies' interests, but  I noticed that landing at the "false" mountain sometimes is better to choose the opposite from the most music liking genie. 
I also noticed that it could be that requesting the same genie more as 3 times in a row is less successful. 
Sometimes the game seemed pretty random and tried to "follow my intuition" by making the choice.
Also, at the end it was pretty hard to concentrate (sometimes I thought I will fall asleep) because in the scanner you are not allowed to move and that reduces your engagement in the task solving.
