About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
In general I always tryed to remember the one that was the winning lamp for each colour. So I would choose the same one again. If it didnt give me the coin I would keep the other sign in mind and go for that one, the next time  that colour came up.

First  I went for one box trying to figure out if it is a "nice one". This wasnt always equally easy so I went back and forth sometimes. 

Few times I broke my pattern - when I felt like it or when I was not focused enough.

Concerning the healthyness: For me the food chioce depends on how hungry I am, since a zucchini wouldnt fill me but some darvida would do so. But I would prefer to prepare a meal with zucchinis rather than eatin a pack of darvida. 

Also the darvida was out of date. I dont mind, but just saying
