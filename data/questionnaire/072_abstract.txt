About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
Random selection in the beginning, using only one type of box. Then played a few rounds to get a feel for which lamp (in the dominant color of that box) gave more rewards, and I stuck to it. Did the same when I got the lamps of the other color. If I felt like my strategy was getting too many 0's, I would start looking once again at the second lamp, to see if the odds have shifted in its favor.
