About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
At the beginning of each task I just tried one out. If I didn't get a coin, I tried the next one. As soon as I got one, I tried it with the same Ginnie again and again until it didn't work anymore. Sometimes I was successfull on both (the blue and the pink one). This was the best case, cause when the wind came and I didn't get to the mountain I wanted I knew which one I wanted to choose. I never tried the same Ginnie in the following round if it didn't show up.
