About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I thought the 4 symbols were similar 2 by 2. Two of them were more similar to the letter "U" while the other twos to the letter "T". When a lamp gave me the money, the following round I used to choose the same box and the symbol corresponding to the letter "T" or "U". 
Aften the first break, when I heard taps coming from outside I used to change the box. For a certain period I thought that short tap meant "change box" and longer tap "change box AND letter"
