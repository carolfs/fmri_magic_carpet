About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
At fisrt I randomly chose one of the boxes and then randomly one of the symbols on the lamps.
For the next round I chose the same box and the same symbol if possble, if the colours had changed I would then choose a new symbol at random. 
Due to the genie appearing randomly, I would only swap my symbol on the lamp if that lamp had yielded no coin for 2-3 times in a row or overall only 50% of the time. 
While this was going on I tried to keep track of which colour yielded more coins in general. If I felt that the more lucrative colour was appearing less often I would switch the box.

 I tried to keep to this system, but I doubt that I managed to follow it exactly, as I could not write down what the results had been.
