About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
As far as I understood, the wind changed the destination with some probability. Then, the reward for a given lamp was either 1 or 0 but sometimes changed for a short period, so usually it was some the same reward for a specific lamp, but I could be wrong.
Initially I had to explore the results for all the lamps, to see which give 1 more frequently. Then, I tried to go to these lamps that seemed lke the usually returned 1.
Finally, if a lamp was not giving the good reward, then I would try not to visit it.
And lastly, as sometimes I could arrive to the wrong destination, I did not want to accidentally arrive to a mountain where both lamps were bad, so I tried to explore/visit different destinations first (as in, one lamp in each), but I am not sure if this had any effect.

About the whole experiment

Do you have any other feedback/issue/concern you would like to tell us about?
-------
Personally I really do not like fish, although I think it may be healthy. Therefore, when given a blind choice, I would prefer to choose something tasty, to minimize the risk of getting fish at the end.

Another thing is that some of the items were unknown to me, so I had to kind of guess what they were. Sometimes their name was in German.
