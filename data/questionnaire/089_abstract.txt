About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I started off by choosinga box at random and then trying both lamps. If either was then successful, i stuck with those two choises until the colour of the lamp changed. When it did, i stayed for one or two more trials and then switched boxes and restarted the process, as descirbed. If this was overall unsuccessful, i would decide to click left, regardless of the symbol on the box and randomly chose either lamp until i was successful. Usually, this was not required, as due to luck and probability, a genie appeared soon enough.
