About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
In the beginning, I just selected either of the boxes (and remembered the symbol of that box for later) to see which lamps turned up. Then I chose one of the two lamps that appeared. If I won a coin, I clicked on the same box and tried to get to the same lamp to click it again. If I was lucky and I won again, I tried to get to that lamp again and again. If I got two negative results in a row from that same lamp, I tried another one. If a lamp gave me a negative result with the first selection, I then already went on to another lamp and tried my luck there. My willingness to try a symbol multiple times increased according to how many times it had given me a positive result before (so if I won a coin only 1 time I would probably try only once more after a negative result, whereas if I won a coin 5 times I would probably try twice more after a negative result).

Generally, I tried to remember which symbols had given me positive results, so I would be ready if the other color (than I expected from clicking on a certain box) appeared.
