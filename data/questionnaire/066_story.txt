About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I had in mind to keep track of which the last result of every symbol was; if a negative result; move to last place in queue. If there is a positive result, try to make the same actions. If by chance I ended up on the wrong mountain, I tried to remember the lamp which least recently gave me a negative result. I thought that longer time between retrying the same lamp might increase the likeliness of a state change.
