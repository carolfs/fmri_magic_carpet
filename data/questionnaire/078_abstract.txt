About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I was alternating between 10 rounds of blue ones and 10 rounds of pink ones. Usually, I always got at least 7 of the desired color. I also chose a particular symbol of the two from that color and picked it several times in a row to see whether more than 50% of the rounds will lead to a coin or not. If yes, I sticked to the symbol, if not I switched to the other when the next set of 10 rounds of that color came. 

I did that throughout the whole experiment.
