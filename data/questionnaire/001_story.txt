About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
First of all I gave names to the symbols according to what they looked like, so I could better remember and dinstinguish them (Moustache, Hebraer, Japaner, Ente). And I also rembered the pink and the blue carpets. 
So I'd always have two current cash cows in the back of mind, a yellow and a blue one, in case that the wind blew me to the other mountain. So I'd think like "Blauer Japaner, Pink Ente", then I'd try to go for either of those. When one of those geenies was tired of my music I'd just swap him with the other one, so let's say the Ente didn't give me a coin, my new (possible) cash-cows would be "Blauer Japaner, Pinker Hebraer".
