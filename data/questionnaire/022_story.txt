About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
Whenever I hit a lamp with a coin, I tried to go back to it until it would not give me a coin anymore, but only up to 3 times. After going to the same lamp 3 times or after a lamp would not give me a coin, I tried to go back to the lamp that i had not visited the longest. For both the blue and the pink mountain I had a lamp of preference that I chose in case I had not visited that mountain for a number of flights, around 5. If this lamp did not give me a coin I tried the other lamp on the same mountain.
