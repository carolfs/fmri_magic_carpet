About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
I tried to understand which door brought with more probability to which color of lamps, and then if one lamp seemes to have I high probability of coins I kept on choosing this one. if the color desired did not appear I used the best lamp of the other color as 'backup plan'. when the probability started to change I focused on the lamp that was more performing in the moment.
