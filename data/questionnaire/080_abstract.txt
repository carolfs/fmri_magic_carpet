About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
First, i tried at random to find out, which simbol would lead to which outcome. I would try to remember my choices, but was not fully concentrated due to the stange environemnt. 
If I was successful, I tried to stay in my line, until there were several times a negative output. As it was explained, that the gains can diminish from time to time, I then changed the strategy in the same box, but with the different lamp. 
As both would lead to unsuccessful outcome,  I also tried to change the box and started from there as well, finding out, which lamp would lead to a better money outcome.
