About the game you played in the fMRI scanner

Please describe in detail the strategy you used to make your choices in the game.
-------
The first 5 to six move I tried to find out a strategy like: the two lines box usually comes with the pink and then the horizontal symbol usually gived the coin. The same was for the box with "one line", blue lamp and then the vertical symbol. Once I found out that the strategy was succsesful I went down 5 to 6 times until it wasn't effectiv anymore. Then repeat, find out which box lead to which lamp and then find out the symbol that led to the coin. Actually it was more difficult in the second part, because I tried to find out if there was a coreletion with the left and right, maybe once the two lines was on the right and the pink lamp with the horizontal symbol on the left it give the coin but wasn't succsesful as I thought.
